# GCC cross compiler for Raspberry PI Zero W

The best tutorial for building the cross compiler for Raspberry PI Zero W I've found there https://solarianprogrammer.com/2018/05/06/building-gcc-cross-compiler-raspberry-pi/
However this tutorial needs some tweaking so that you can compile Java 17 and successfully run it on Raspberry PI Zero W.
